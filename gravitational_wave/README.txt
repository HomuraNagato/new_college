Will use data gathered from the International Pulsar Timing Array Data Challenge 1 Open Data Set (reference: http://www.ipta4gw.org/?page_id=126) to detect gravitational waves using simulated pulsar data.

Millisecond pulsars produce predictable pulses, and can be used as Galactic clocks. Disturbances in the clocks from a passing gravitational wave will produce an identifiable signature, which with the right model, can be detected.
